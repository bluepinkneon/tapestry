## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Smart contract bugs | Extensive testing, soft launch period |
| Gas costs too high | Optimization pass, L2 deployment |
| Pool manipulation | Price floor, closed initial period |
| Cost overruns | Platform absorbs as growth investment |

### Economic Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| DYE price instability | Soft launch to gather data |
| Insufficient WEAVE liquidity | Build inventory before pool opens |
| hTUSD deficit growth | Revenue tracking, monthly reconciliation |

### Operational Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Backend failures | Queue system, retry logic |
| Provider outages | Minimal registry for future providers |
| User adoption | Free entitlements drive usage |

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Continuous)
- Each function tested independently
- Edge cases covered
- Gas consumption tracked

### Integration Testing (Week 7)
- Full user flows
- Multi-contract interactions
- Event emission verification

### Soft Launch Testing (Week 8)
- Real-world usage patterns
- Cost model validation
- Performance monitoring

### Security Testing
- Reentrancy tests
- Access control verification
- Invariant testing
- Fuzzing for edge cases

## Deployment Strategy

### Testnet Deployment (Week 7)
```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $TESTNET_RPC --broadcast --verify
```

### Mainnet Deployment (Week 10)
1. Deploy with multisig as owner
2. Verify all contracts
3. Configure roles and permissions
4. Transfer ownership to multisig
5. Enable features progressively

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Gas cost per FIBER: <300,000 gas
- Transaction success rate: >99.9%
- System uptime: >99.5%
- Test coverage: >95%

### Economic Metrics
- DYE price stability: <10% daily variance
- Pool price floor: Always maintained
- hTUSD/TUSD ratio: Trending positive
- Distribution fee collection: 100% success

### User Metrics (Post-Launch)
- Daily active users
- Entitlement claim rate
- FIBER creation rate
- Pool trading volume

## Key Decisions Made

Based on protocol clarifications:
1. **Pool starts closed**: Build inventory first
2. **WEAVE always soulbound**: No exceptions
3. **No auto-burns**: Manual monthly reconciliation
4. **DYE price formula**: hTUSD supply / DYE supply
5. **Relative timing**: 6-hour smooth intervals
6. **Expiry compaction**: Automatic during operations
7. **Provider registry**: Minimal but ready for expansion
8. **Price floor**: Mint hTUSD + burn DYE when needed

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. Set up development environment
2. Create GitHub repository
3. Initialize Foundry project
4. Begin token implementation

### Planning Actions
1. Finalize team assignments
2. Set up project management
3. Create communication channels
4. Schedule weekly sync meetings
