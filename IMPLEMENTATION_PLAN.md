## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Smart contract bugs | Extensive testing, formal verification for critical paths |
| Gas costs too high | Early optimization, consider L2-specific optimizations |
| Oracle failures | Fallback mechanisms, manual override capabilities |
| Backend scalability | Queue system, horizontal scaling preparation |

### Timeline Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Audit delays | Book auditor early, have backup options |
| Integration issues | Parallel development tracks, early integration tests |
| Scope creep | Clear phase boundaries, defer nice-to-haves |
